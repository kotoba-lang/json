;; Run the `.kotoba` case batches for kotoba/json_scalar.kotoba on all three
;; semantic targets (`:jvm-kir`, `:js`, `:wasm`) via amu's official harness.
;;
;; Why a splicer instead of one self-contained test file:
;;
;; - `amu test` takes a SINGLE source text, so a case can only call code in
;;   the same file. Keeping the cases in the library file would ship test
;;   exports inside the artifact a host imports.
;; - That harness runs every case of one file against ONE instance, and fuel
;;   is charged per function entry, so a whole suite shares one 512-unit
;;   budget. Measured 2026-08-29: 23 cases in one file trap after the 12th on
;;   `:js` and `:wasm`, while all 23 pass on `:jvm-kir`. Hence batches.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 all passed, 1 a case failed, 2 the suite could not be RUN
;; (missing input, unparseable report, a target that did not report). 2 is
;; distinct from 1 on purpose -- "could not answer" must not look like
;; "answered, and it was fine".
