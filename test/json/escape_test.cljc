(ns json.escape-test
  "String escapes, on BOTH runtimes.

  `json.core-test` is `.clj`, so the codec's own tests have only ever run
  on the JVM -- and `run-tests.cljs` says so in its header. This namespace
  is `.cljc` for exactly the reason that header gives: the bug it was
  written for was invisible to a JVM run, and a JVM run was all there was.

  ## The bug

  `hex-val` compared against `(int \\a)`. ClojureScript has no character
  type -- `\\a` IS the string \"a\" -- and `cljs.core/int` is
  `(bit-or x 0)`. JavaScript coerces \"a\" to NaN, and `NaN | 0` is 0. So
  `(int \\a)` was 0, not 97.

  What made it survive: `(int \\5)` really is 5, because \"5\" coerces. So
  digits worked, hex letters became 0, and every escape still decoded to
  *some* character. `\\u65e5` came out as U+6505 -- 攅 where 日 was
  written."
