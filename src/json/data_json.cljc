  "clojure.data.json-compatible surface on `json.core`.

  Measured 2026-08-29: kotoba-lang still had 39 repos on
  `org.clojure/data.json` for `read-str` / `write-str` / `read` with
  `:key-fn`. This namespace exists so retiring that JVM dependency is a
  require-line change rather than hundreds of call-site edits.

  Migration surface, not the preferred API — new code should call
  `json.core/encode` and `json.core/decode` directly."

  `clojure.data.json/read-str` is `[string & options]`, so every call site this

  three arguments. The original signature here took an options MAP, so those
  call sites threw `ArityException: Wrong number of args (3)`. A migration
  surface that requires editing the call sites has no reason to exist, and the
  docstrings promised a contract the code did not have.

  The map form is kept because this namespace shipped with it and callers
