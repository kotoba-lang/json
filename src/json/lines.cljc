  "NDJSON / JSON Lines — one JSON value per line.

  It lives beside `json.core` rather than in a repo of its own because it is
  not a format so much as a **framing** of this one: the values are JSON, and
  everything here is about where one ends and the next begins.

  ## What makes it worth writing down

  A JSON string may contain `\\n`. So `split-lines` then `decode` is wrong on
  any file with a newline inside a string value — and wrong *quietly*, because
  the two halves each fail to parse and the obvious repair (skip bad lines)
  discards a record that was perfectly valid. `read-lines` scans for a newline
  **outside** a string, tracking escapes, exactly as a CSV reader must.

  That is also the reason NDJSON, like CSV, can only ever be read whole: you
  cannot seek to record N without having read everything before it, because a
  newline is only a record boundary outside a string. In the kotobase lake this
  registers as `:materialize`, and that is a property of the format.

  ## What it does not do

  **Skip malformed records.** A line that does not parse raises, with its line
  number. `:on-error :skip` is available and has to be asked for, because a
  reader that drops what it cannot understand turns a corrupt file into a
  short one, and nothing downstream can tell a short answer from a small one."
